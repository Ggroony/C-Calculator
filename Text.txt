Week 4 Calculator Project: Notes

The following is my project implementing UDT's as a simple calculator for users. 

The system implements a template in the header file, and then directly implements it into the main.cpp along with the template class
that was created. Users can enter the two numbers, which are stored into template variables, allowing the program
to accept any type of entry. Then the program will ask the user for a operator variable, and based on that entry the program will perform the
desired mathmatic operation. 

Thank you! 

Issues: I am gettting the error LNK2019 saying there is an unresolved error. I attempted to research this and the advice I got online
was to switch some settings and make sure my references to functions were correct. They appear to be, so I'm not sure why the program will 
not run. Any advice?
